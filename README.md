# Babua LearnOS – Learning Decision Engine

A product-first learning system designed to help students make better learning decisions when they are stuck.

---

## ❓ Problem
Students don’t fail due to lack of content.  
They fail because when they get stuck, they don’t know **what to do next**.

Most platforms:
- Push more videos
- Sell courses
- Ignore confusion diagnosis

---

## 💡 Solution
Babua LearnOS is a **Learning Decision Engine**, not a content platform.

It:
- Diagnoses why a student is stuck
- Recommends the next best learning action
- Escalates to mentorship only when necessary
- Encourages reflection and intentional learning
